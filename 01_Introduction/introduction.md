📌 Summary: Introduction to JavaScript

1️⃣ What is JavaScript?

    * JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive.

    * It allows dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and more.

    * JS is a core part of web development, along with HTML (structure) and CSS (styling).


    📌 Key Takeaways:
    ✅ JavaScript runs in browsers and is used for front-end & back-end development.
    ✅ It can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).
    ✅ JavaScript follows an event-driven, single-threaded model with asynchronous features.





2️⃣ History and Evolution of JavaScript

    * Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich in 10 days while working at Netscape.

    * Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, before becoming JavaScript.

    * Standardized as ECMAScript (ES) to maintain compatibility.

    * Modern JavaScript is powerful, supporting ES6+ features, frameworks, and Node.js.


    📌 Key Takeaways:
    ✅ JavaScript was made for adding interactivity to web pages.
    ✅ Over time, it evolved from basic scripting to a full-fledged programming language.
    ✅ Major updates introduced ES5 (2009), ES6 (2015), and ESNext (ongoing).




3️⃣ ECMAScript and JavaScript Versions (ES5, ES6, ESNext)

    * ECMAScript (ES) is the official specification for JavaScript.

    * ES5 (2009) introduced strict mode, JSON support, Array.map(), Object.create().

    * ES6 (2015) was a major update with features like:

            1. let & const (block-scoped variables)

            2. Arrow functions (=>)

            3. Template literals (Hello ${name})

            4. Classes (class and extends)

            5. Destructuring and spread/rest operators

            6. Promises and async/await

    * ESNext refers to future JavaScript versions with new proposals and features.


    📌 Key Takeaways:
    ✅ ES6 (2015) brought major improvements to JavaScript.
    ✅ Modern JavaScript (ESNext) continues to evolve with new features.
    ✅ Learning ES6+ is essential for writing clean, modern code.




4️⃣ How JavaScript Works in Browsers vs Node.js

    * In browsers, JavaScript runs on a JavaScript Engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).

    * JS interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model) to modify web pages dynamically.

    * Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side development.

    * Node.js uses the V8 engine and provides APIs for file system, networking, databases.


    📌 Key Takeaways:
    ✅ Browsers execute JavaScript to control webpage behavior.
    ✅ Node.js is a runtime environment that lets JavaScript run on servers.
    ✅ JavaScript in browsers is limited to front-end, while Node.js extends its capabilities to back-end development.
